<h2>A brief summary of Gandhi's journey</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, which was then part of the British Empire.
Although young Gandhi wanted to become a doctor, his father, who served as a chief minister in Porbandar, persuaded him to study law.
After 3 years of studies in London (where he became a vegetarian), Gandhi came back to India and tried to start his career as a lawyer.
Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, 
politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came 
to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve 
political and social progress.

In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). 
The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the 
route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night.
 “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during 
 his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.
</p>
<h3>South Africa</h3>
<p>
Africa was to present to Gandhi challenges and opportunities that he could hardly have conceived. In the end he would 
spend more than two decades there, returning to India only briefly in 1896–97. The youngest two of his four children were born there.
After struggling to find a job in India, he went to South Africa for a one-year contract to perform legal services. 
Gandhi was there confronted with discrimination against Indian immigrants by British authorities. 
At the end of his contract, Gandhi fought against a bill that would ban Indians from voting. 
Although he didn't stop the bill from passing, it initiated his fight for equality of human rights.
</p>
<h3>The religious quest</h3>
<p>
Gandhi’s religious quest dated back to his childhood, the influence of his mother and of his home life in Porbandar and Rajkot,
but it received a great impetus after his arrival in South Africa. His Quaker friends in Pretoria failed to convert him to Christianity, 
but they quickened his appetite for religious studies. He was fascinated by the writings of Leo Tolstoy on Christianity, read the Qurʾān in 
translation, and delved into Hindu scriptures and philosophy. The study of comparative religion, talks with scholars, and his own reading of 
theological works brought him to the conclusion that all religions were true and yet every one of them was imperfect because they were “interpreted with poor intellects,
sometimes with poor hearts, and more often misinterpreted.”
Shrimad Rajchandra, a brilliant young Jain philosopher who became Gandhi’s spiritual mentor, convinced him of “the subtlety and profundity” of Hinduism, 
the religion of his birth. And it was the Bhagavadgita, which Gandhi had first read in London, that became his “spiritual dictionary” and exercised probably 
the greatest single influence on his life. Two Sanskrit words in the Gita particularly fascinated him. One was aparigraha (“nonpossession”), which implies that 
people have to jettison the material goods that cramp the life of the spirit and to shake off the bonds of money and property. 
    
</p>
<h3>Return to India</h3>
<p>
In 1914, Gandhi sailed from South Africa to India, where he founded an ashram that was open to all castes.
Gandhi decided to leave South Africa in the summer of 1914, just before the outbreak of World War I. He and his family first went to London, where they remained for several months. 
Finally, they departed England in December, arriving in Bombay in early January 1915.

</p>


</p>
<h3>India’s Independence</h3>
<p>
After a series of protests, India's independence was inevitable.
The Government of India Act (1935) surrendered significant amounts of power to Indians, and the Indian National Congress clamoured for more.
But after World War II Muslim League demanded that a separate state be created for India's Muslims, and to Gandhi's great distress, the Congress leaders agreed.
In August 1947, India was finally independent, not as a whole but divided into two countries, India and Pakistan. 
</p>
<h3>Assasination</h3>
<p>
Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist, Nathuram Godse, in Delhi on January 30, 1948.
Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacency towards Muslims, holding him responsible for the frenzy of violence and suffering.
Gandhi's death was mourned nationwide, and over a million people joined the five-mile-long funeral procession that took over five hours. 
</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>
Gandhi's commitment to nonviolence and his belief in simple living — making his clothes, eating a vegetarian diet — has been a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world for decades to come after his death.
Gandhi's actions inspired future human rights movements around the globe, including those of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States and Nelson Mandela in South Africa. 
He was a frail man who wore glasses and a traditional Hindu loincloth called a dhoti, walked with a bamboo staff, and had a toothless grin. He looked like a simple Hindu holy man. But armed only with great
 courage and a strong commitment to nonviolent resistance, Mohandas Gandhi took on one of the world’s mightiest empires.
For nearly 30 years, Gandhi led the movement that eventually forced Britain to grant independence to India, its most prized colony, in 1947. The subcontinent was partitioned, or divided, into two nations: India and Pakistan.
In October, celebrations will ring out across India in honor of the 150th birthday of Gandhi, known as the “Father of the Nation.” Today India is the world’s largest democracy, and it has the fifth largest economy in the world,
 according to the International Monetary Fund. However, tensions have recently risen between the nation’s Hindu majority and its Muslim minority, as well as between India and Pakistan. And many experts believe the region is moving 
 away from the ideals for which Gandhi fought.
